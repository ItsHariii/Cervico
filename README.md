Cervico - AI-Powered Cervical Dilation Tracker

Overview

Cervico is an AI-powered application designed to monitor and estimate cervical dilation progression using transvaginal ultrasound technology. This innovative tool aims to provide non-invasive, real-time cervical dilation tracking during labor, reducing the need for frequent manual cervical checks.

Features

AI-Powered Cervical Dilation Estimation: Uses convolutional neural networks (CNN) to analyze cervical dilation images.

Tampon-Style Ultrasound Patch: A wearable, transvaginal ultrasound device that provides continuous monitoring.

Real-Time Mobile App Interface: Displays dilation measurements, labor progress trends, and alerts for active labor.

Early Stage Prototype with Diagrams: Initial model training using medical diagrams before integrating real ultrasound data.

Predictive Labor Tracking: Combines contraction frequency and dilation trends to predict labor progression.

Epidural Timing Alerts: Notifies patients when it is the optimal time to receive an epidural based on dilation and contraction patterns.

How It Works

Data Input

Users wear the Cervico Patch as instructed, which captures real-time cervical images.

Initially, AI is trained using diagram-based cervical dilation images and will later incorporate real ultrasound data.

AI Processing

The AI model analyzes images to detect cervical opening size (in cm).

Predictions are refined with real ultrasound training data over time.

User Alerts & Insights

The mobile app notifies users when dilation reaches active labor (~4 cm).

Users receive trend reports and insights on labor progression.

Provides alerts for the best time to receive an epidural, ensuring optimal pain management timing.
